3. Ensure your code follows the existing style
4. Make sure your code lints
5. Write a clear commit message

## Development Setup

1. Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quickdraw-classification.git
cd quickdraw-classification
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and concise

## Ideas for Contributions

### Easy
- Fix typos in documentation
- Add more example images
- Improve code comments
- Add unit tests

### Medium
- Implement data augmentation techniques
- Add more visualization options
- Optimize model hyperparameters
- Add more drawing categories

### Advanced
- Implement transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Create a web deployment (Flask/FastAPI)
- Add model interpretability (Grad-CAM)
- Implement ensemble methods
- Create a mobile app version

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Run the entire notebook to ensure everything works
2. Test with different classes if you modified model code
3. Check that visualizations render correctly
4. Verify documentation is up to date

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update requirements.txt if you add dependencies
- Comment your code clearly

## Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

Example:
```
Add data augmentation for training

- Implement random rotation
- Add horizontal flip
- Include zoom augmentation
Closes #123
```
