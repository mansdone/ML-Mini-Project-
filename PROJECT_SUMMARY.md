## 💡 Key Insights

### What Worked Well
✅ Simple CNN architecture (V2) outperformed complex ones  
✅ Non-binarized data performed better than binarized  
✅ Adam optimizer with default settings was sufficient  
✅ No dropout needed due to large dataset  
✅ 20 epochs provided good convergence

### Challenges
⚠️ Cat vs Dog confusion (similar sketch patterns)  
⚠️ SVM training is slow on full dataset  
⚠️ Classical ML struggles with spatial features  
⚠️ Low resolution (28×28) limits detail

### Surprises
💡 Simpler CNN (V2) beat complex architectures  
💡 Polynomial SVM beat RBF kernel  
💡 High confidence even on misclassifications  
💡 Model robust to noise up to σ=0.2
